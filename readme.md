# Build a Personal Library
This is a solution to the "Library Project" on <i>The Odin Project </i>: 
https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/library?ref=lnav.

The page is test-deployed at: https://hankangbok.github.io/jsLibraryOdinProject/.
The current working version of this project uses 'innerHTML' to create functioning buttons that will let the user add/remove/toggle features of books within their library.

Future plans include:
- Designing a more visually appealing page theme
- Finding a better way to populate individual 'book' items
